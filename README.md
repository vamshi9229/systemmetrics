# System Monitoring Script

This script is designed to monitor various system metrics, services, and logs. It checks essential metrics, sets thresholds, implements error handling, and extracts the outputs into a metrics.txt file.

•	Monitors CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network activity.
•	Verifies the status of critical services and alerts if any service is not running.
•	Scans logs for specific patterns or errors and raises alerts accordingly.
•	Sets customizable thresholds for each metric and service to trigger warnings or errors.
•	Implemented robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected issues.
•	Extracts monitored information into a metrics.txt file for easy reference.
